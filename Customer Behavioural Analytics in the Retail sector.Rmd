__Overview and motivation:__ <font color ="black"> A customer is a key-centric factor for any business to be successful. Conventional wisdom tells us that the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. In order that a business has a sustainable growth, the retention of its old customer base and expansion of the new customer base is very critical. This demands from a business to understand the behaviour of its customers in relation to the business. Therefore obtaining a 360&deg; view of its customers is crucial for a business looking for a competitive edge in the market. In such a scenario, Customer Behavioural Analytics plays an important role in leveraging data analytics to find meaningful behavioural patterns in the customer-specific business data. <br/>
Consequently, this project aims to understand the consumer behaviour in the retail sector. Decoding the consumer behaviour will be based on understanding how consumers make purchase decisions and what factors influence those decisions. This project also aims to discover existence of dependencies between customers, products and shops to highlight further insights about their behaviour. These meaningful insights will further help a business to implement stratergies leading to an increased revenue through customer satisfaction.

__Data source:__ <font color ="black"> Supermarket aggr.Customer^[https://bigml.com/user/czuriaga/gallery/dataset/5559c2c6200d5a6570000084] <br />
The dataset to be used is the retail market data of one of the largest Italian retail distribution company called _Coop_ for a single Italian city [@pennacchioli2013explaining].<br />
The Supermarket aggr.Customer dataset used for the analysis contains data aggregated from the original datasets^[http://www.michelecoscia.com/?page_id=379] [@pennacchioli2013explaining] and mapped to new columns. The dataset thus contains 40 features with 60,366 instances and is approximately 14.0 MB in size. </font>

__Exploratory data analysis:__ 
<font color ="black">Reserch question 1</font> 
<br />
In the first question, we are trying to find out whether there is a relationship between long distances and the average price tag in the store. In order to better understand, check the existence of this dependence is to investigate separately the data that relate to distances and average prices.
First of all, it is worth checking the existence of a certain relationship between price and distance, which is well reflected by the covariance.
Based on the scatterplot, it can be noted, that the average price is close enough to zero, therefore, it makes a sense to check zero values in the current dataset and its influence. In this context, zero values are equal to the missing values. Therefore, we replaced the zero values with the missing ones and verified by plotting, if some values are deleted. The scatterplots were constructed again and we tried to compare them with those that were obtained for covarience visualisation earlier.
Further, it was interesting to consider the density of the distribution of the average cost for each individual shop in order to understand their variations. It is convenient to use lines for displaing the distribution, since in this way it will be easier to observe the intersection of the quantities.
Since it became clear from the first part of the analysis, that exists the strong relationship between distance and average cost, than it should be to explore the subtleties that remain. For this it should be created some model, that predicts price from dependencies and then computes the residuals (the difference between the predicted value and the actual value). The residuals give us a view of the price, once the effect of distance has been removedTo do this, we will use the technique of building a template and display it with scatterplot.Once the strong relationship between distance and price had been removed, relationship between shop and price relative other external factors (better quality of products, products alternative and so on) became noticable.
