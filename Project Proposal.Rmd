# Exmaple usage of labelling and reusing code chunks
# ```{r iris_plot, echo = FALSE, eval = FALSE}
# library(ggplot2)
# ggplot(iris, aes(x = Species, y = Sepal.Length)) + geom_boxplot()
#```

# ```{r , ref.label='iris_plot', fig.width = 7, fig.height = 2.5}

# Inline R code usng r
# A random sample of 5 numbers from the set of numbers between 
# 1 and 10 is `r sample(1:10, 5)`
