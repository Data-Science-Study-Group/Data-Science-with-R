Screencast Storyline (1 min)

Frame1: Coop is the largest Italian retail distribution company.
Frame2: Considering a single Italian city Coop has 5 shops located at different places
Frame3: These shops have an existing customer base who are located at different distances from these shops
Frame4: Based on their preference a customer visits only specific shops out of them
Frame5: As long as the customer is satisfied, the business is growing, the sales are high, more & more revenue is generated and
        the business team is more than happy
Frame6: One fine day the business team realize that their sales are going down, profit has downscaled, the business is not generating
        the adequate revenue and the marketing costs are increasing day by day
Frame7: Suddendly the business team discovers that although they are acquiring new customers, the old customers are not being retained. 
        The team is now clueless as to what steps to take next and eventually decide to call Data Analytics Team CuBA for help
Frame8: Convential Wisdom tells us that the cost of retaining an existing customer is far less than acquiring a new one. It is possible
        that a Customer is bombarded with the wrong promotional offers of outlets that he never visits or that the unique products for
        which he travels to long distance shops are always out-of-stock. This eventually builds upon the customer's disappointment and he
        then chooses to search for an alternative. 
Frame9: But how can this customer behaviour be decoded in order to implement strategies leading to high customer satisfaction?
        And the answer here is Customer Behavioural Analytics.

         and a sustainable growth for the business.
